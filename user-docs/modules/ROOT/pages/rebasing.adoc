= Rebasing to New Versions

The `rpm-ostree rebase` command allows you to switch between multiple branches.
The `ostree remote` command allows you to view and change repository options.


== Listing Remote Repositories

The `ostree remote` command has several options:

----
$ ostree remote --help
Usage:
  ostree remote [OPTION…] COMMAND

Remote commands that may involve internet access

Builtin "remote" Commands:
  add               Add a remote repository
  delete            Delete a remote repository
  show-url          Show remote repository URL
  list              List remote repository names
  gpg-import        Import GPG keys
  add-cookie        Add a cookie to remote
  delete-cookie     Remove one cookie from remote
  list-cookies      Show remote repository cookies
  refs              List remote refs
  summary           Show remote summary

Help Options:
  -h, --help        Show help options

Application Options:
  -v, --verbose     Print debug information during command processing
  --version         Print version information and exit
----

List remote repository names:

----
$ ostree remote list
fedora-iot
----

Show the remote URL:

----
$ ostree remote show-url fedora-iot
https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot
----

List the remote reference branches:

----
$ ostree remote refs fedora-iot
fedora-iot:fedora/stable/aarch64/iot
fedora-iot:fedora/stable/x86_64/iot
fedora-iot:fedora/devel/aarch64/iot
fedora-iot:fedora/devel/x86_64/iot
fedora-iot:fedora/rawhide/aarch64/iot
fedora-iot:fedora/rawhide/x86_64/iot
----

== Adding and Removing Remote Repositories

The ostree remote repository configuration files are located in the `/etc/ostree/remotes.d` directory.

----
$ cat /etc/ostree/remotes.d/fedora-iot.conf 
[remote "fedora-iot"]
url=https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot
gpg-verify=true
gpgkeypath=/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
contenturl=mirrorlist=https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot/mirrorlist
----

The first line specifies the name of the remote that will be shown with `ostree remote list`. The additional lines are in the format of 'KEY=VALUE'.

To add a remote repository use the `ostree remote add` command:

----
$ ostree remote add --help
Usage:
  ostree remote add [OPTION…] NAME [metalink=|mirrorlist=]URL [BRANCH...]

Add a remote repository

Help Options:
  -h, --help                        Show help options

Application Options:
  --set=KEY=VALUE                   Set config option KEY=VALUE for remote
  --no-gpg-verify                   Disable GPG verification
  --if-not-exists                   Do nothing if the provided remote exists
  --gpg-import=FILE                 Import GPG key from FILE
  --contenturl=URL                  Use URL when fetching content
  --collection-id=COLLECTION-ID     Globally unique ID for this repository as an collection of refs for redistribution to other repositories
  --repo=PATH                       Path to OSTree repository (defaults to /sysroot/ostree/repo)
  --sysroot=PATH                    Use sysroot at PATH (overrides --repo)
  -v, --verbose                     Print debug information during command processing
  --version                         Print version information and exit
----

The `--set` option can be used multiple times to configure any KEY=VALUE pair. Some of the more common or required keys have their own options.
For example, the following two commands result in identical configuration files. They differ only in how the contenturl is specified:

----
$ sudo ostree remote add --set=contenturl=mirrorlist=https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot/mirrorlist --set=gpgkeypath=/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ fedora-iot 'https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot'
----

----
$ sudo ostree remote add --contenturl=mirrorlist=https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot/mirrorlist --set=gpgkeypath=/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ fedora-iot 'https://ostree.fedoraproject.org/iot'
----

To delete a remote repository use:

----
$ sudo ostree remote delete fedora-iot
----


== Moving between Build Trees

Currently there are three branches, the stable, develop, and rawhide branches. Each branch corresponds to the Fedora release that's the latest stable (stable), rawhide and if Fedora currently has a branched version that is undergoing stablisation in preparaiton for release (devel).

You need to specify the architecture as part of the branch option. 
At the moment the options are aarch64 or x86_64.

To rebase to stable:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree rebase -b fedora/stable/<ARCH>/iot
----

To rebase to devel:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree rebase -b fedora/devel/<ARCH>/iot
----

To rebase to rawhide:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree rebase -b fedora/rawhide/<ARCH>/iot
----

Once ready, reboot the system to use the new image:

----
$ sudo systemctl reboot
----

== Rebase to any New Version

Recent releases will automatically import the release keys in the specified directory if they are present on a rebase.

----
Usage:
 ostree remote gpg-import [OPTIONS...] NAME [KEY-ID...]
----

Provide the reference path for the new version in the rebase command:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree rebase VERSION
----

The process is very similar to a system update.
The new OS is downloaded and installed in the background.
Once ready, reboot the system to use the new image:

----
$ sudo systemctl reboot
----

Just like system updates, rebases can be reversed.
The previous deployment is still available, and you can boot back into it if there are any problems with the new OS.
