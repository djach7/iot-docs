= Updates and Rollbacks

NOTE: The latest image builds are available https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/iot/[here].

== Upgrade to the Latest Image
Display the status of the currently running deployment:

----
$ rpm-ostree status

The `rpm-ostree` command is used to manage the atomic system tree used by the Fedora IoT images. The `update` command is an alias for the `upgrade` command.

----

Preview the package differences:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree upgrade --preview
----

If you wish, you can download the packages only and not deploy them with:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree upgrade --download-only
----

To apply the OSTree update deltas available on CDN use the following command:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree upgrade
----

Due to the atomic nature of the OS, you will have to reboot into the new image to have the updates take effect:

----
$ systemctl reboot
----

== Rollback to a previous tree

The `rpm-ostree` utility keeps two deployments available. 
Both have an entry in the bootloader menu. 
The new updated entry with be the default. 
If necessary, you can choose the other entry to boot into the previous deployment.

TIP: The timeout for GRUB2 to display the menu is very short at only one second. Pressing the space bar or an arrow key when the menu appears will interrupt the timeout and allow you to choose another entry. The ENTER key will boot the selected image. 

To permanently switch back to the previous deployment:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree rollback
----

Like with the upgrade, a system reboot will be required. You can use the `systemctl reboot` command or you can include the `--reboot` option when you issue the rollback command:

----
$ sudo rpm-ostree rollback --reboot
----

NOTE: More information about https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/bootloading-with-grub2/[Bootloading with GRUB2] can be found in the Fedora Quick Docs.

NOTE: More information about the `rpm-ostree` command can be found in the upstream https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/administrator-handbook/[Administrator Handbook]


== Automatic updates

A `rpm-ostreed` service is available to monitor for upgrades automatically.

To enable automated updates edit the `/etc/rpm-ostreed.conf` file. The options
available are as follow:

* The 'none' option disables automatic updates. This is the default policy.
* The 'check' option downloads enough metadata to display available updates with `rpm-ostree status`.
* The 'stage' option downloads, unpacks and stages the update which will be finalized on a reboot.
* The 'apply' option is the same as stage but also initiates the reboot to the new version.

----
# cat /etc/rpm-ostreed.conf 
# Entries in this file show the compile time defaults.
# You can change settings by editing this file.
# For option meanings, see rpm-ostreed.conf(5).

[Daemon]
AutomaticUpdatePolicy=check
#IdleExitTimeout=60
----

Next we need to enable the appropriate services:
----
systemctl reload rpm-ostreed
systemctl enable rpm-ostreed-automatic.timer --now
----

We should now be able to see the state of automatic updates in the status:
----
# rpm-ostree status
State: idle
AutomaticUpdates: stage; rpm-ostreed-automatic.timer: last run 4min 22s ago
----

The rpm-ostreed-automatic.service and rpm-ostreed-automatic.timer control frequency of checks and upgrades.
